# CS683-Project1

When starting this project I had to do a fair bit of research in order to make the worm properly as well as ensure that it did not spread. The first thing I did was to implement a function to scan IP addresses only within my network as to ensure that it did not spread to other networks. When I configured the range I made sure that only my pi that was sharing an internet connection with my laptop would get the malware payload. I then created another function to brute force ssh into my pi by reading a text file of possible usernames and passwords, of course putting the right combination in so I would be able to ssh into the pi. Once I was able to ssh in the pi I put two files onto the pi and ran them. One was a scanner.py file which would scan the network within a certain range for other possible computers to infect. The second was the malware I would infect the pi with which in this case was a simple fork bomb program named malware.py that I would run. The malware perpetually created background child processes until the pi crashed. 

A source I used for this project was http://hackoftheday.securitytube.net/2013/04/simulating-ssh-worm-using-python.html which explained how to use the Paramiko library to use Python to ssh into another computer.
